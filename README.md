# Golang Server-Based Project 
This repository contains a server-based project built using Golang as part of my backend learning journey.
The main goal of this project is to understand how servers work internally, how requests are handled, and how backend applications are structured in real-world development.
# What I Learned
- Creating an HTTP server using Golang
- Understanding the `net/http` package
- Handling client requests and server responses
- Working with routes and handlers
- Structuring a backend project properly
- Using Git and GitHub for version control
# Tech Stack
- Language: Golang
- Server: net/http
